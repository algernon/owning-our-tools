This is my talk proposal for the [FOSDEM 2018 Hardware Enablement
Devroom][fosdem:hwen], currently a work in progress.

# Owning our tools

Or how having open source input devices opens up a whole new world.

## Abstract

For people who work with computers, be them hackers, gamers or anyone else, an
efficient input device is essential. These are the tools we use daily, through
which we interact with the computer the most (at least, in many cases). Yet,
very few of these devices have open source firmware, and we don't seem to mind
that very much. In this talk, I will highlight why that is wrong. I will show
you examples of astonishing productivity boosts one can accomplish with a fully
programmable, open-source keyboard. I will show you how being able to control
our input devices is not only liberating, but a tremendous boost to not only our
productivity, but our feeling of comfort as well.

## Submission notes

I'm submitting this talk to the hardware enablement devroom for a variety of
reasons, ranging from a desire to show how open source firmware, on open source
keyboards can boost our productivity, through singing praise of the custom
keyboard community, to a wish to highlight the importance of really owning our
most precious input devices.

The hardware enablement devroom appears to be the perfect fit for this kind of
talk.
